# CS585_JGEOM_JDBC_JAVASWING_Project
About the project -This is an interactive Java swing based application which tracks the demographics plan and position of lions in a lion sanctuary. When the user clicks on a specified region, all the lions and ponds in that region would be highlighted.
Objective         -The main objective of this project is to store the 2D objects of spatial database such as Regions, ponds, ambulance, lions & pond which are part of lion sanctuary using Oracle spatial database(Oracle 11g). The Java Swing application retrieves the positions of region, pond, lion from oracle database using Java JDBC  and displays(2d drawing using Java paint method) the location and position of regions, lions and ponds on the highlighted region. This project uses dynamic Java Swing interactive methods to display the lion santuary
Programming languages used - Java Swing, SQL, JGEometry, Java Paint methods, JDBC for connectivity, Java JGeom for storing spatial coordinates.
